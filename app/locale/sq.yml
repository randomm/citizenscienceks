      paragraph_1: Welcome to citizen science community in Kosovo! Looks like you are interested to participate in Citizen Science movement in Kosovo and we would be happy to host you in our community. Our commitment is to combine social values with scientific practices, and out community groups at the core of the project. We are certainly looking for volunteers, young (and old!) scientists, activists, campaigners, technologists, educator, hackers, journalists… and everyone else who really care for air pollution and environment.
      paragraph_2: Applying citizen science methods and techniques requires significant time, efforts, fieldwork and endless hours in front of computers. And we don’t expect you to do it alone; therefore we want to create a movement around citizen science, which can support local actions, researches, investigations and can run educational activities with children and youth.  In the end, citizen science is not only characterized with scientifically work and measurements – we also do have a great deal of fun
