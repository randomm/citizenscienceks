      paragraph_1_original: Welcome to citizen science community in Kosovo! Looks like you are interested to participate in Citizen Science movement in Kosovo and we would be happy to host you in our community. Our commitment is to combine social values with scientific practices, and out community groups at the core of the project. We are certainly looking for volunteers, young (and old!) scientists, activists, campaigners, technologists, educator, hackers, journalists… and everyone else who really care for air pollution and environment.
      paragraph_2_original: Applying citizen science methods and techniques requires significant time, efforts, fieldwork and endless hours in front of computers. And we don’t expect you to do it alone; therefore we want to create a movement around citizen science, which can support local actions, researches, investigations and can run educational activities with children and youth.  In the end, citizen science is not only characterized with scientifically work and measurements – we also do have a great deal of fun
      paragraph_3_original: Come and join us and let’s do great things together!

    main_para_1: What API? API stands for application programming interface. It is a way to retrieve and reuse data programmatically.
    main_para_2: All data gathered and processed by Science for Change is open and public, and one way we are open is that we offer APIs to data gathered by the project members. You can use the data APIs described on this page freely. We currently offer data APIs to diffusion tube, ghost wipe and Smart Citizen Kit data gathered during autumn 2014.
    main_para_3: Please note that all API endpoints described here are still subject to change, as this service is currently evolving at a fast pace. In case of any problems, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.
